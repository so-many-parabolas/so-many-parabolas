   <Hi it's your girlfriend <br>
    I've had quite the semester workload <br>
    You're an amazing boyfriend <br>
    You know I can't code <br>
   
   I love you so much<br>
   Javascript is hard<br>
   My dog's name is Dutch<br>
   I should have made you a card<br>
   
   I cant use CSS<br>
   But this website is for you<br>
   You are the best<br>
   I hope you know I love you too<br>
